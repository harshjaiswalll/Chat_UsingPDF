# Sandbox Interface

## Description
This project provides a web interface to interact with a machine learning model deployed on AWS Bedrock Runtime. The interface allows users to ask questions and receive responses generated by the model.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required Python packages by running:
4. Set up your AWS credentials by either configuring AWS CLI or directly in the code where `boto3.client` is called.
5. Modify the `model_id` and AWS credentials in the `app.py` file to match your setup.
6. Run the Flask server by executing:
7. Access the interface by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage
1. Type your question in the input field provided.
2. Press the "Send" button or hit Enter to submit your question.
3. The model will generate a response to your question, and it will appear in the chat window.
4. Continue the conversation by asking further questions.

## Files
- `app.py`: Python script implementing the Flask server and interaction with AWS Bedrock Runtime.
- `index.html`: HTML file defining the structure of the web interface.
- `style.css`: CSS file containing styles for the interface.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file handling user interactions and communication with the Flask server.

## Dependencies
- Flask: Python web framework used for running the server.
- boto3: Python library for interacting with AWS services.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that your AWS credentials have appropriate permissions to access Bedrock Runtime and the specified model.
- The interface currently supports only text-based questions and responses.
- Customize the interface appearance and behavior by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
